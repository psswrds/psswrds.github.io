Online service for generating and remembering passwords.

## Why?
Many people use the same password for multiple programs / services. It's not very good from a security: if You steal a password from one service, the attackers will automatically get access to other.
PSSWRDS allows to solve this problem. You still remember just one password (in this case, a secret phrase), but for different services, You will use different passwords that generates PSSWRDS.

## How does it work?
You enter the secret phrase, the service name, username (if required). Then click on the 'Generate' and generate :) For this combination, the phrase-tools-login generated password is always the same. So You can with any device and at any time to obtain the same password for the same service (of course, knowing the secret phrase). Also You can save the file index.html and easy to use it locally without access to the interenet.

## What about safety?
PSSWRDS't retain, store, convey any entered and / or generated by Your data anywhere and to anyone. I wish to make? - welcome to the source, they are very simple. You can study the source codes saving files to your computer, opening them directly in the browser or on github.
